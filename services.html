                    <h3>LIFE INSURANCE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Life insurance is a crucial financial tool that provides peace of mind and financial 
                        security to you and your loved ones. It is a contract between you and an insurance company, 
                        wherein you pay regular premiums, and in return, the insurer promises to pay a lump sum amount, 
                        known as the death benefit, to your designated beneficiaries upon your passing.<br><br>

                        <b>Types of Life Insurance</b><br>

                        There are different types of life insurance policies, each designed to meet specific needs. The most common types include:<br>

                        1. <b>Term Life Insurance:</b> Offers coverage for a specified period, typically 10, 20, or 30 years. It provides affordable protection and is ideal for those seeking coverage for a specific term, such as during the years of a mortgage or until children become financially independent.<br>
                        2. <b>Whole Life Insurance:</b> Provides lifetime coverage with a guaranteed death benefit. It also includes a cash value component that grows over time, providing a source of savings and potential access to funds for various financial needs.<br>

                        expenses. It is a contract between you and an insurance provider, wherein you pay regular 
                        premiums, and in return, the insurer helps cover the costs of medical treatments, 
                        hospitalizations, and other eligible healthcare services.<br><br>
